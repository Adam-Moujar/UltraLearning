# Rust

This is my second version of the steps I will take to learn Rust. The first version was done before fully reading ultralearning
and so this is one where I use the steps outlined in the section "your first ultralearning project" in the book.

## Metalearning

### What topics will I learn?, and what scope? 

- I want to at first learn the different syntax of Rust and everything that Rusts offers me as features. 
- I will also like to learn about idiomatic ways to code in Rust.
- The best ways to approach and structure code. 
- Any helpful outside libraries.
- Fastest ways to do certain things which come up a lot. 
- In essense, I want to learn Rust, how to use it and use it properly, and any tips and tricks available to more advanced use. 

### Primary resources you will use:

- The rust book
- Rust by Examples
- Rustlings
- Rust in Action
- My own projects then on. 

The idea is that the rust book and rust by examples will teach me the fundemental knowledge I need to know before I begin, syntax, features, etc...
Then rustlings will be as a way to make those stick to my mind by practicing retrieval. And finally rust in action is quite useful as a way to tackle
real life problems. After I gather all that knowledge, I will be able to efficiently and quickly begin tackling my own problems without any outside help. 

### Benchmark of how others have learnt rust:

The number one commonly seen advice is to simply code. Coding your own projects will give you the knowledge of, well, coding. 
However in the poll done in reddit, it seems that the most common way that people learn rust was by reading the book first. 
In general there are 2 strategies: 

- Jumping straight to coding, better suited if you are coming from another language.
- Use resources like the book, before going back to coding. 

### Direct practice activities

This is where the rust in action book is really helpful. It is a book dedicated to problems a person can tackle in their way of learning Rust. 
Of course, also doing my own projects is one option. All in all, not being able to practice is not a problem when it comes to coding. 

### Backup materials and drills

Other material that I have considered are: 

- https://exercism.org/tracks/rust : Exercises for rust.
- https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate : A great youtube viedo which loves to cover Rust and other adjacent content. 
- Rust for rustaceans book: Ways to learn the idiomatic language pieces. 

## Schedule my time: 

As of 19/06/2025 I have a lot of time, I'm currently searching for a job after finishing uni so the time I have to spend on rust is quite a lot. 
I would like to spend 6hrs a day on Rust, everyday, if possible. Starting at:

- 9am start
- 1pm break
- 2pm start
- 4pm finish

I would probably also like to chunk that time more, rather than have large 4 hr blocks.
