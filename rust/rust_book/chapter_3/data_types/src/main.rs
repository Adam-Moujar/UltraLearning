// Rust is a statically typed language, the compiler needs to know the
// types of the variables before we begin running the program.
//
// Usually though, the rust compiler is smart enough to infer what
// type you mean to use. Sometimes you will need to nudge it, like in
// the parsing example (man this is one recurring example) in ch2 where
// it needed to know what type to parse into.
