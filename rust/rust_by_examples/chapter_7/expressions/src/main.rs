// This is pretty basic stuff
// Expressions return values
// Statements do things (in general)
//
fn main() {
    // There are 2 types of statements,
    let x = 5;
    // expressions with ;
    x;
    // Blocks are expressions and return the last time, so long as it has no semicolon
    let y = { 2 * x };
}
