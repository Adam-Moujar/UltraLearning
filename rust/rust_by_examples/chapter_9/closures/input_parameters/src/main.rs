// When a closure is an input as parameter it must be annotated using a few traits:
// 1. Fn: the closure captures values by reference &T
// 2. FnMut: The closure captures values by mutable reference &mut T
// 3. FnOnce: The closure captures values by value T
//
// Since a closure, even with these traits, will try to capture in the order of decreasing
// restriction, a closure that is annotated by fnonce, capturing values by T, could still capture
// variables by &T, &mut T or T depending on what is the least restrictive thing.
// A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.
// <F> denotes that F is a "Generic type parameter"
fn apply<F>(f: F)
where
    // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.
    F: FnOnce(),
{
    // ^ TODO: Try changing this to `Fn` or `FnMut`.

    f();

// A function which takes a closure and returns an `i32`.
fn apply_to_3<F>(f: F) -> i32

    // The closure takes an `i32` and returns an `i32`.
