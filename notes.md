### Personal Notes on UltraLearning

Many of the first pages of UltraLearning are, as many other first pages of 
self-improvements books, simply a pitch sale, coaxing the reading
into considering ultralearning for their life, as a way to significantly speed up the learning
of skills/knowledge. 

The author uses examples of people he has met/heard of, which have accomplished incredible things
using ultralearning and also explains that while these may be the most extreme positive examples of ultralearning,
anyone can still enjoy many incredibly positive advantages, so long as they approach ultralearning seriously.

I've been historically someone who doesn't focus on the mental aspects of self-improvement.
When, for example, reading up on Atomic Habits, of which the first couple of sections are dedicated on the
mental aspects and the why's for using Atomic Habits, 
I am someone who didn't really pay attention or consider it that deeply. 

My reasoning being not for any detrimental reasons, but rather that I considered the practical reasons more imporant. 
My idea of a human being mostly stems from a computer science approach, viewing the human body as nothing more than 
a biological robot. And thus, so long as you change the inputs, I could get the outputs, what I do, how I think etc...
to change. 

As more time goes on, this idea of biological robots seems less and less helpful for my self-improvement.
Not to say there are no benifits to this model, but there's quite a lot of examples, both personal and from other people,
where a strict adherance to practical advice with little regard to the mental side has led to a lack of positive change. 
And where many people's routine and habits change seemingly overnight without using any methodology or steps, from a simple
change in their mental approach.

Therefore, it is very important that I truly understand just how positively it could affect my life.
I admire the approach of ultralearning. Something that I continously strive for is to be great at what I love.
To be great at coding, to great at speaking to be great at my hobbies. 

A quote that embodies why this is so important to me is:<br/>
"Being good means being free" - Haikyu!! (My favourite piece of fiction ever)<br/>
I want to be great to not be tied down to anything. And I think ultralearning is what I need to make that true.
