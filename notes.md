# Personal Notes on UltraLearning

Many of the first pages of UltraLearning are, as many other first pages of 
self-improvements books, simply a pitch sale, coaxing the reading
into considering ultralearning for their life, as a way to significantly speed up the learning
of skills/knowledge. 

The author uses examples of people he has met/heard of, which have accomplished incredible things
using ultralearning and also explains that while these may be the most extreme positive examples of ultralearning,
anyone can still enjoy many incredibly positive advantages, so long as they approach ultralearning seriously.

I've been historically someone who doesn't focus on the mental aspects of self-improvement.
When, for example, reading up on Atomic Habits, of which the first couple of sections are dedicated on the
mental aspects and the why's for using Atomic Habits, 
I am someone who didn't really pay attention or consider it that deeply. 

My reasoning being not for any detrimental reasons, but rather that I considered the practical reasons more imporant. 
My idea of a human being mostly stems from a computer science approach, viewing the human body as nothing more than 
a biological robot. And thus, so long as you change the inputs, I could get the outputs, what I do, how I think etc...
to change. 

As more time goes on, this idea of biological robots seems less and less helpful for my self-improvement.
Not to say there are no benifits to this model, but there's quite a lot of examples, both personal and from other people,
where a strict adherance to practical advice with little regard to the mental side has led to a lack of positive change. 
And where many people's routine and habits change seemingly overnight without using any methodology or steps, from a simple
change in their mental approach.

Therefore, it is very important that I truly understand just how positively it could affect my life.
I admire the approach of ultralearning. Something that I continously strive for is to be great at what I love.
To be great at coding, to great at speaking to be great at my hobbies. 

A quote that embodies why this is so important to me is:<br/>
"Being good means being free" - Haikyu!! (My favourite piece of fiction ever)<br/>
I want to be great to not be tied down to anything. And I think ultralearning is what I need to make that true.

## Principle 1: Meta-Learning

UltraLearning is not just about really intense learning, but also a commitment to incredibly
efficient and pointed learning.

And the first step to this efficiency is Meta-Learning, learning about the way you will learn.

The overarching steps you need to answer during Meta-Learning are Why? What? and How?

- Why you are learning what you are learning?
- What exactly are you learning? and break it down to its parts and nuances
- How is it you will learn?

Each part comes with a method to help answer the question. 

- Expert Interview Method to help answer why:

Interview somebody who has learnt the skill you are seeking to learn to help research whether or not
the skill does in fact help you achieve your goals. It is important to not be shy, it is quite likely that 
the expert would love to share a bit of their time to help newcomers who are passionate about their expertise. 
Be forward and confident, while also being mindful of not taking too much of their time, 15mins is a good time frame. 

- Breaking down the skill/knowledge into Concepts, Facts and Procedures to help answer what. 

Knowledge can be broken down into 3 parts:
- Concepts: Ideas to be understood to be useful. stuff like abstraction in software development.
- Facts: Information that simply needs to be memorized, stuff like syntax in coding.
- Procedures: Skills that need to be practiced, stuff like diffentiation in calculus. 

- Benchmarking to help answer how:

Finally for how the learning will take place, benchmarking, learning how other people in the past has
learnt the skill/knowledge helps massively. Looking up courses, commonly repeated advice and the ways
experts have learnt their subject will serve as a really good way to find your own way to learn the skill.
It is very important that you do not just take these at face value and always emphasize or exclude the different
advice depending on whether they are helpful for your own journey.

### How long should I Meta-Learn for? 

The book recommends a good rule of thumb of 10%, that is 10% of your ultralearning process should be spent
researching how to learn the project. Another method, which I find most compelling, is research until you 
find yourself not covering new ground. If you research for an hour and end up with fruitful findings, then it is very
likely that you should still meta-learn some more however, if you find yourself getting the same answers or not going anywhere
during your research, it's time to and start learning the skill. 

## Principle 2: Focus

If principle 1, focus on the strategising to make any future learning much simpler and efficient, principle 2 and its methods
tackle the issue of focus and concentration. Making sure the ultralearning is being done without distractions.

Focus is split into 2 distinct parts:
- Starting focus
- Mainting focus

### Failing to Start Focus (aka Procrastinating)

This is the main problem many people face in their journey of self-improvement: procrastination. 
Instead of focusing on the very important task, you work on something else, or you slack off. 

Why do we procrastinate? 

Its for 2 reasons: 

1. You either crave to do something else
2. You have an aversion to do the task

The first one is the simplest to explain, rather than working on your project, you could be playing games,
watching videos, going out etc... Doing things that are much more entretaining than the project. 

The second one is a bit more subtle. It manifests as a mental block for a task. You don't want to do the project 
because you think you aren't good enough, you don't apply because you fear rejection etc... 
Rather than other tasks being more entretaining, there's something about the project which puts you off. 

### Crutch Method to Start Focus

Given these 2 reasons people procrastinate, There's a method to stop procrastination and start on a task. 
A lot of procrastination is unconcious, or given excuses by us. "We are taking a break" or "I'm having fun while I can"
So the first step of learning to stop procrastination is to simply recognise it. 

This will actually be something familiar if you read a lot of books on meditation. When meditating, one of the skills you learn
is being concious of when your focus has moved away, which is why meditation is so important in my opinion. Being concious 
of what you do, is often enough to stop procrastinating and going back to the task, however we can take this concious note and 
do more with it. 

Ask yourself everytime you are procrastinating, why did you do it?

- Where you averse to the task?
- Did you get bored?
- Frustrated? 

Building awareness and being concious of your actions is a very powerful tool, make sure you hone the skill and note every time 
you start to procrastinate. 

The second step of learning to stop procrastination is to start resisting procrastination. If the first step is to simply recognise it
and make a mental note of it, the second step is when we begin to combat it. Tearing down the reasons that you have noticed in the first step
and give yourself a small but digestible start to the task.

For example:

Once you begin procrastinating, you catch on very quickly since you have practiced the skill of awareness. You notice that you simply got distracted,
your phone had a notification which brought your attention to something else. You can take steps to mental get rid of your distraction 
and go back to the task, much like in meditation. I also like taking steps of physically removing whatever caused the distraction.

After that, you can coax yourself to re-start the task by giving yourself a goal of doing the task for 5 minutes. A very small amount of time
that anyone can sustain. Once 5 minutes is something that becomes very easy to do, you can slowly stretch the time from 5, to 10, to 25, to 
eventually hours. At the end, such method will become unnecessary and you will be able to focus on any given task. 

### Sustaining Focus

Once starting focus, which is the first part of this principle, becomes quite easy, the next part to tackle is to learn to sustain
focus. Before we talk about sustaining focus, we must talk about what type of focus we would like to focus on.
This is quite an interesting and important part, as not all focus is equal. Many people are aware of something called "Flow",
a state where you stop being interrupted, you are completly absorbed and the line between unconcious and concious is blurred. 
Flow is enjoyable and in competition, the best state to be in to deliver results. *However*, research done by K. Anders Ericsson, a 
psychologist, argues that for flow is inconsistent with the demands of deliberate practice. You should *not* be in flow during 
ultralearning. It is very important that:

1. You tackle projects and tasks of whoose dificulty is too high to enter flow
2. The most important one, you must be concious during ultra learning.

To learn, and to learn effectively, self-conciousness is a requirement. Flow is antithetical to the best learning and so the advice is:

- Do not worry about flow, focus on tasks which are slightly more difficult. 

That is not the type of focus we are trying to reach nor sustain. 

Since we've discussed, how we should focus, not let us consider duration. This is a rather subjective decision to make. 
The literature seems to agree that practice broken down into separate studying periods is more effective than cramming. 
Similarly, even with solid blocks of study, interleaving different skills to practice seems to be more effective
than learning one skill at once. 

The book suggests, 50mins to 1hour learning blocks for atsks, with several minutes as a break before moving on to the next task. 
Again, this is quite a subjective decision, since it's a question of what time you have open to study. 
Let's beggin discussing how to combat distractions by talking about the sources of distractions themselves. 

### Distraction 1: Your environment.

Do you have your phone off, is it visible, do you have noise in the background, is all your equipment ready. 
Anything that could bring your focus away from your learning tasks is a possible distraction. 
And it is important that you nip in the bud anything which serves as a distraction around you as much as you reasonably can. 

### Distraction 2: Your task.

Reading is harder to focus on than watching a video. Doing projects is a much easier time to focus
than research. Choose a task which is easier to focus on. *However*, it is important that the task you choose
doesn't supersede other considerations, like the future principles of directness (Principle 3) or feedback (Principle 6).

Usually these principles are aligned, a task is hard to focus on if the cognitive load is too low such as reading and research.
Pairing this tasks with something like taking notes, which brings the cognitive load up could help to make it easier to focus on.

### Distraction 3: Your mind.

We are back to meditation practices baby, man are they useful. Another source of distractions is your mind itself. Negative emotions
like anxiety, worries about the future, negative events in your life and an endless other emotions can make it harder to focus on your task. 
For any emotion brought about by something in your life, it might be important to first tackle the problem before beginning your ultralearning 
project. However, not all emotions stem from problem and you will find yourself worrying about things or the future even if 
there isn't something you can directly do about it.

For these negative emotions, simply letting them pass, making a note of them, being aware of what it is and simply moving on
is often enough to remove the emotion itself. A lot of this advice comes from mindfulness practice in buddhism, from 
practices like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and ancient practices of Stoicism. 


### Improving focus

As any action that is repeatable, directing focus, maintaining it and refining it are all skills. Skills which you can improve on
and eventually master to the point of repeating it seamlessly. It will be possible for you to master
your focus to such a level and it may happen sooner than you may thing, simply if you as with all skills, 
do them repeatedly.

## Principle 3: Directness

"Directness is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in." - Direct quote from the book. 
Having spent essentially 2 decades of my life, which at the point of writing this I am 22,  in education. I have many thoughts
and feelings about schooling. I will not say it is useless, I believe I wouldn't have found my love for coding had it not
been for my choice to take it as a subject during GCSE. However, one of the very big detriments of learning in school and something
that has affected me up until now is this lack of directness when learning. 

In school, when you learn something it is never to solve a problem, not as a direct result of a task and not as a way
to solve any problem, but simply to pass a test. This makes it so that learning for a problem is not something
which is natural, directness is not something that is taught. If the skill you are trying to learn is talking 
in another language, apps like duolingo are fun, but they do not directly solve the problem. 

Directness is arguably the *center* of ultralearning projects, to learn not for the sake of learning, but for the 
sake of the skill and as such, we learn in the most efficient, direct manner possible. Many other ultralearning enthusiasts
learn by doing the thing itself:

- Roger Craig when he did his ultralearning project for Jeopardy! learn by doing past Jeopardy! questions
- Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley, learnt art for video games by doing art for video games. 
- Benny Lewis learnt languages by following a policy of strictly speaking only that language. 

Traditional learning is so far removed from this type that this seems foreign to us.

Directness is the cornerstone of ultralearning. 
Learn the skill by doing the skill:

- Learn to code by coding.
- Learn to speak a language by speaking it.
- Learn to pass the MIT curriculum by taking the tests. 

Do the thing! Do the thing! Do the thing!
A book will never supplant the skill itself.

Now to be clear, directness is not something that is always replicable or easy to do. 
I would love to take the MIT final tests, but I have one shot. I would love to start 
speaking another language right now, but I have no one to speak with. 
And in those cases, we come as close to the skill itself as we can.
