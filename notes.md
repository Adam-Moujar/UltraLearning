# Personal Notes on UltraLearning

Many of the first pages of UltraLearning are, as many other first pages of 
self-improvements books, simply a pitch sale, coaxing the reading
into considering ultralearning for their life, as a way to significantly speed up the learning
of skills/knowledge. 

The author uses examples of people he has met/heard of, which have accomplished incredible things
using ultralearning and also explains that while these may be the most extreme positive examples of ultralearning,
anyone can still enjoy many incredibly positive advantages, so long as they approach ultralearning seriously.

I've been historically someone who doesn't focus on the mental aspects of self-improvement.
When, for example, reading up on Atomic Habits, of which the first couple of sections are dedicated on the
mental aspects and the why's for using Atomic Habits, 
I am someone who didn't really pay attention or consider it that deeply. 

My reasoning being not for any detrimental reasons, but rather that I considered the practical reasons more imporant. 
My idea of a human being mostly stems from a computer science approach, viewing the human body as nothing more than 
a biological robot. And thus, so long as you change the inputs, I could get the outputs, what I do, how I think etc...
to change. 

As more time goes on, this idea of biological robots seems less and less helpful for my self-improvement.
Not to say there are no benifits to this model, but there's quite a lot of examples, both personal and from other people,
where a strict adherance to practical advice with little regard to the mental side has led to a lack of positive change. 
And where many people's routine and habits change seemingly overnight without using any methodology or steps, from a simple
change in their mental approach.

Therefore, it is very important that I truly understand just how positively it could affect my life.
I admire the approach of ultralearning. Something that I continously strive for is to be great at what I love.
To be great at coding, to great at speaking to be great at my hobbies. 

A quote that embodies why this is so important to me is:<br/>
"Being good means being free" - Haikyu!! (My favourite piece of fiction ever)<br/>
I want to be great to not be tied down to anything. And I think ultralearning is what I need to make that true.

## Principle 1: Meta-Learning

UltraLearning is not just about really intense learning, but also a commitment to incredibly
efficient and pointed learning.

And the first step to this efficiency is Meta-Learning, learning about the way you will learn.

The overarching steps you need to answer during Meta-Learning are Why? What? and How?

- Why you are learning what you are learning?
- What exactly are you learning? and break it down to its parts and nuances
- How is it you will learn?

Each part comes with a method to help answer the question. 

- Expert Interview Method to help answer why:

Interview somebody who has learnt the skill you are seeking to learn to help research whether or not
the skill does in fact help you achieve your goals. It is important to not be shy, it is quite likely that 
the expert would love to share a bit of their time to help newcomers who are passionate about their expertise. 
Be forward and confident, while also being mindful of not taking too much of their time, 15mins is a good time frame. 

- Breaking down the skill/knowledge into Concepts, Facts and Procedures to help answer what. 

Knowledge can be broken down into 3 parts:
- Concepts: Ideas to be understood to be useful. stuff like abstraction in software development.
- Facts: Information that simply needs to be memorized, stuff like syntax in coding.
- Procedures: Skills that need to be practiced, stuff like diffentiation in calculus. 

- Benchmarking to help answer how:

Finally for how the learning will take place, benchmarking, learning how other people in the past has
learnt the skill/knowledge helps massively. Looking up courses, commonly repeated advice and the ways
experts have learnt their subject will serve as a really good way to find your own way to learn the skill.
It is very important that you do not just take these at face value and always emphasize or exclude the different
advice depending on whether they are helpful for your own journey.

### How long should I Meta-Learn for? 

The book recommends a good rule of thumb of 10%, that is 10% of your ultralearning process should be spent
researching how to learn the project. Another method, which I find most compelling, is research until you 
find yourself not covering new ground. If you research for an hour and end up with fruitful findings, then it is very
likely that you should still meta-learn some more however, if you find yourself getting the same answers or not going anywhere
during your research, it's time to stop and start learning the skill. 

## Principle 2: Focus

If principle 1, focus on the strategising to make any future learning much simpler and efficient, principle 2 and its methods
tackle the issue of focus and concentration. Making sure the ultralearning is being done without distractions.

Focus is split into 2 distinct parts:
- Starting focus
- Mainting focus

### Failing to Start Focus (aka Procrastinating)

This is the main problem many people face in their journey of self-improvement: procrastination. 
Instead of focusing on the very important task, you work on something else, or you slack off. 

Why do we procrastinate? 

Its for 2 reasons: 

1. You either crave to do something else
2. You have an aversion to do the task

The first one is the simplest to explain, rather than working on your project, you could be playing games,
watching videos, going out etc... Doing things that are much more entretaining than the project. 

The second one is a bit more subtle. It manifests as a mental block for a task. You don't want to do the project 
because you think you aren't good enough, you don't apply because you fear rejection etc... 
Rather than other tasks being more entretaining, there's something about the project which puts you off. 

### Crutch Method to Start Focus

Given these 2 reasons people procrastinate, There's a method to stop procrastination and start on a task. 
A lot of procrastination is unconcious, or excused by us. "We are taking a break" or "I'm having fun while I can"
So the first step of learning to stop procrastination is to simply recognise it. 

This will actually be something familiar if you read a lot of books on meditation. When meditating, one of the skills you learn
is being concious of when your focus has moved away, which is why meditation is so important in my opinion. Being concious 
of what you do, is often enough to stop procrastinating and going back to the task, however we can take this concious note and 
do more with it. 

Ask yourself everytime you are procrastinating, why did you do it?

- Where you averse to the task?
- Did you get bored?
- Frustrated? 

Building awareness and being concious of your actions is a very powerful tool, make sure you hone the skill and note every time 
you start to procrastinate. 

The second step of learning to stop procrastination is to start resisting procrastination. If the first step is to simply recognise it
and make a mental note of it, the second step is when we begin to combat it. Tearing down the reasons that you have noticed in the first step
and give yourself a small but digestible start to the task.

For example:

Once you begin procrastinating, you catch on very quickly since you have practiced the skill of awareness. You notice that you simply got distracted,
your phone had a notification which brought your attention to something else. You can take steps to mental get rid of your distraction 
and go back to the task, much like in meditation. I also like taking steps of physically removing whatever caused the distraction.

After that, you can coax yourself to re-start the task by giving yourself a goal of doing the task for 5 minutes. A very small amount of time
that anyone can sustain. Once 5 minutes is something that becomes very easy to do, you can slowly stretch the time from 5, to 10, to 25, to 
eventually hours. At the end, such method will become unnecessary and you will be able to focus on any given task. 

### Sustaining Focus

Once starting focus, which is the first part of this principle, becomes quite easy, the next part to tackle is to learn to sustain
focus. Before we talk about sustaining focus, we must talk about what type of focus we would like to focus on.
This is quite an interesting and important part, as not all focus is equal. Many people are aware of something called "Flow",
a state where you stop being interrupted, you are completly absorbed and the line between unconcious and concious is blurred. 
Flow is enjoyable and in competition, the best state to be in to deliver results. *However*, research done by K. Anders Ericsson, a 
psychologist, argues that flow is inconsistent with the demands of deliberate practice. You should *not* be in flow during 
ultralearning. It is very important that:

1. You tackle projects and tasks of whose dificulty is too high to enter flow
2. The most important one, you must be concious during ultra learning.

To learn, and to learn effectively, conciousness is a requirement. Flow is antithetical to the best learning and so the advice is:

- Do not worry about flow, focus on tasks which are slightly more difficult. 

That is not the type of focus we are trying to reach nor sustain. 

Since we've discussed, how we should focus, now let us consider duration. This is a rather subjective decision to make. 
The literature seems to agree that practice broken down into separate studying periods is more effective than cramming. 
Similarly, even with solid blocks of study, interleaving different skills to practice seems to be more effective
than learning one skill at once. 

The book suggests, 50mins to an hour learning blocks for tasks, with several minutes as a break before moving on to the next task. 
Again, this is quite a subjective decision, since it's a question of what time you have open to study. 
It will be something that is quite personalised for each different ultralearning project and not something that can be
given a hard rule to follow. 

Combating distractions is also an important part of mainting focus, so we will break down the different sources for 
distractions and how to resist them.

### Distraction 1: Your environment.

Do you have your phone off, is it visible, do you have noise in the background, is all your equipment ready. 
Anything that could bring your focus away from your learning tasks is a possible distraction. 
And it is important that you nip in the bud anything which serves as a distraction around you as much as you reasonably can. 

### Distraction 2: Your task.

Reading is harder to focus on than watching a video. Doing projects is a much easier time to focus
than research. Choose a task which is easier to focus on. *However*, it is important that the task you choose
doesn't supersede other considerations, like the future principles of directness (Principle 3) or feedback (Principle 6).

Usually these principles are aligned, a task is hard to focus on if the cognitive load is too low such as reading and research.
Pairing this tasks with something like taking notes, which brings the cognitive load up could help to make it easier to focus on.

### Distraction 3: Your mind.

We are back to meditation practices baby, man are they useful. Another source of distractions is your mind itself. Negative emotions
like anxiety, worries about the future, negative events in your life and an endless other emotions can make it harder to focus on your task. 
For any emotion brought about by something in your life, it might be important to first tackle the problem before beginning your ultralearning 
project. However, not all emotions stem from problem and you will find yourself worrying about things or the future even if 
there isn't something you can directly do about it.

For these negative emotions, simply letting them pass, making a note of them, being aware of what it is and simply moving on
is often enough to remove the emotion itself. A lot of this advice comes from mindfulness practice in buddhism, from 
practices like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and ancient practices of Stoicism. 


### Improving focus

As any action that is repeatable, directing focus, maintaining it and refining it are all skills. Skills which you can improve on
and eventually master to the point of repeating it seamlessly. It will be possible for you to master
your focus to such a level and it may happen sooner than you may thing, simply if you as with all skills, 
do them repeatedly.

## Principle 3: Directness

"Directness is the idea of learning being tied closely to the situation or context you want to use it in." - Direct quote from the book. 
Having spent essentially 2 decades of my life, which at the point of writing this I am 22,  in education. I have many thoughts
and feelings about schooling. I will not say it is useless, I believe I wouldn't have found my love for coding had it not
been for my choice to take it as a subject during GCSE. However, one of the very big detriments of learning in school and something
that has affected me up until now is this lack of directness when learning. 

In school, when you learn something it is never to solve a problem, not as a direct result of a task and not as a way
to solve any problem, but simply to pass a test. This makes it so that learning for a problem is not something
which is natural, directness is not something that is taught. If the skill you are trying to learn is talking 
in another language, apps like duolingo are fun, but they do not directly solve the problem. 

Directness is arguably the *center* of ultralearning projects, to learn not for the sake of learning, but for the 
sake of the skill and as such, we learn in the most efficient, direct manner possible. Many other ultralearning enthusiasts
learn by doing the thing itself:

- Roger Craig when he did his ultralearning project for Jeopardy! learn by doing past Jeopardy! questions
- Eric Barone, creator of Stardew Valley, learnt art for video games by doing art for video games. 
- Benny Lewis learnt languages by following a policy of strictly speaking only that language. 

Traditional learning is so far removed from this type that this seems foreign to us.

Directness is the cornerstone of ultralearning. 
Learn the skill by doing the skill:

- Learn to code by coding.
- Learn to speak a language by speaking it.
- Learn to pass the MIT curriculum by taking the tests. 

Do the thing! Do the thing! Do the thing!
A book will never supplant the skill itself.

Now to be clear, directness is not something that is always replicable or easy to do. 
I would love to take the MIT final tests, but I have one shot. I would love to start 
speaking another language right now, but I have no one to speak with. 
And in those cases, we come as close to the skill itself as we can. 

### How to learn Directly

#### Tactic 1: Project-Based Learning

Rather than classes, use projects based on the skill. If you want to learn how to make video games. Simply start a project to
make a video game. This is the core idea behind directness. Learning how to make the project itself will require 
for you to learn all the different aspects that go into it. E.g:

Learning to make videogames will require you to learn how to:

- Compose the music.
- Draw the art.
- Game design.
- Script the game.
- Write the story.
- ...

#### Tactic 2: Immersive Learning

Surrounding yourself with the target environment which the skill is practiced. Learning a language is the canonical example 
of where immersion works. Putting  yourself in a situation where you must speak the language, since you have no other choice. 
Language speaking is not the only one however, to link it to programming, joining a open-source project and being an active 
member will expose you to new coding challenges and working with other people.

#### Tactic 3: Flight Simulator Method

Sometimes there's no way to practice the skill directly like piloting a plane or surgery. In that case, what matters is 
creating a learning environment which poses many of the same cognitive problems as the skill you are learning. Such as 
using a flight simulator as a way to learn how to pilot a plane. The level of graphics is not that important since, again,
what matters is the cognitive challenges themselves.

#### Tactic 4: Overkill Approach

The last challenge is to increase the difficulty of the skill or the challenge themself. When Tristan de Montbello. when preparing
to compete in the World Championship of Public Speaking, spoke at middle schools. The idea being that toastmaster clubs would be 
too soft and congratulatory compared to middle school children. Another example I love is going to Smash Tournaments when learning 
how to play. The difficulty being much higher so any mistake you do will be thoroughly exposed and taken advantage of.

It is imperitive in ultralearning to projects to keep the principle of directness in your mind. 
Ultralearning isn't just simply cramming and learning with intensity. If that was true, then it would be no different
that traditional schooling. It is learning with purpose. 

## Principle 4: Drill

Scott H. Young talks about rate-determining step. In chemistry, these are reactions in a chain of reactions which take the longest
and thus bottleneck the rest of the process. He points that there are aspects of this which mirror learning and skills at large. 
The example he gives is mathematics. It is a complex skills with many moving parts, and yet even if you understand the
concepts at a fundemental level and remember the algorithms and methods to solve the problem, if your algebra
and arithmetic skill are lacking then you will get the wrong answers. 

Thus drills are all about finding these rate-determining steps, the parts in our skill and knowledge which hold back 
everything else, so we can isolate them and work on them specificially. 

However you might have a problem with this drill approach, the last principle talked about learning a skill directly, however
drill stands as a opposite to this, rather than learning the larger skill, you break it down into smaller abstract components
and practice those instead, so what gives? 

### The Direct-Then-Drill Approach

To resolve this tension one can use a direct-then-drill approach. The idea being simple: You tackle the skill/knowledge 
directly, taking up a coding project, trying to speak another language, collaborating in a open-source project. 
And then analyze your performance and find the subskills which you lack and drill those. 

This creates a feedback loop: 

Direct -> Analyze -> Drill -> Direct. 

Sometimes the drills we come up with are not going to be transfere well, or at all. This is fine, in our feedback loop after going
back to direct from drill, we will be able to see if these drills really were helpful. If they were not, that's okay, nothing much lost.

The earlier in the learning process you are, the faster the cycle should be. Cycling between direct practice and drills, even withing
the same section. As you get better and it takes a lot more effort to improve your performance, longer detour into drills might
be more neccesary. 

### How to Design Drills

When applying this principle, first we have to figure out when and what to drill. As stated before, rate-determining steps in skill
or performance is ideally what we should focus on. The skills which when improved, would cause the greatest improvement to our ability.
The key is to experiment, hypothesise what exactly is the subskill which holds you back the most and attack that. Use the direct-then-drill
approach to quickly analyse whether or not that is truly the right way or not. 

The second thing we need to tackle is designing drills to produce improvement. It might be easy to pick apart what is lacking
from your performance, but to create drills which isolate those without removing much of the challenge might be an issue. 

And finally, doing drills are often uncomfortable and hard. By design, drills are to improve and sharpen that which we struggle with. 
Doing things we suck at is often irritating, boring and frustrating. Often when learning, many people take the approach of doing the 
pleasant things, so drills stick out as unnatural and often distressing.

Let's look at some good ways to do drills to combat these problems. 

#### Drill 1: Time Slicing

The easiest way to create a drill is to isolate a slice of time in a sequence of actions. 
Musicians will often drill a hard section, Basketball players will often drill 3s, Football players will often drill
passing and shooting. Looking for parts of a skill which are fundamental and repeated a lot to drill is often the first
step to consider.

#### Drill 2: Cognitive Components

This drill is quite similar to the first one, but rather than a slice of a larger skill, its a cognitive component. 
When speaking a language, you have many cognitive moving parts. Grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary occur at all moments. 
Taking one of these cognitive components and dirlling it in isolation might help without being bogged down by the nuances 
of the other components. 

#### Drill 3: Copycat

Somtimes, specially in creative skills, it is impossible to practice one aspect of a skill without doing the others. 
In such cases, it might help if you copy the parts of the skill that you don't want to drill. If software testing is what you want to drill
then maybe copy down a problem and its solution from the internet so you only need to focus on testing.
If practicing coloring/shading in art, take a picture which already has everything except shading and coloring done. 

#### Drill 4: Magnifying glass

What if, even then, you cannot isolate a particular subskill? The magnifying glass method is all about spending significantly more time
on the subskill than the rest of the problem. If research is the skill you want to drill, you can spend an unbalanced amount of time
researching.

#### Drill 5: Prerequisite Chaining

Finally, a drill often done is to start with a skill that you don't have the prerequisites for. Then, when you inevitably do poor,
you can go back, learn one of the fundemental subskills and repeat the exercise. An example of this is Eric Barone, Stardew Valley creator,
rather than doing a course on pixel art, he simply dived right into it. When he found that he struggled with colors, he learnt color theory, 
and then went back and retried. 

### Mindful Drilling

Something which I think is quite important is the idea of mindfulness. Often when the topic of drilling comes up, the parroted
advice that comes up is "get the reps in", simply doing the drill without giving your all, hoping that it becomes
muscle memory eventually. I believe this approach is wrong. It is very important that you remain focused and mindful while doing
drills so that you don't become sloppy. If you do not actively try to use drills to conciously improve your weaknesses, you will find
yourself improving at a much slower rate, or not at all.

## Principle 5: Retrieval

This is the most academically motived principle. There was a study done by psychologists Jeffrey Karpicke and Janell Blunt 
that examined students choice of learning strategy and their effectiveness. The students were divided into 4 groups:

- Reviewing a text a single time
- Reviewing it repeatedly
- Free recall
- Concept mapping

Then they would be tested. When asked to predict their scores, it went as followed:

1. Reviewing repeatedly
2. Reviewing once
3. Concept mapping
4. Free recall

The actual tests however, were incredibly different. Testing yourself, that is free recall, outperformed all the 
other testing strategies by a incredibly large margin. One might wonder if its to do with the context of the study. 
Since the principle of directness tells us that to improve at something you must do it, since the students were tested 
at the end of the study, the students who used free recall by repeated studying must have done better. But even if the final 
method was changed to produce a concept map, free recall still outperformed all the other methods, even concept mapping.

Another explanation is feedback. Testing comes with the added benefit of telling you when you are right or wrong. 
However again when the study was changed so that feedback was removed, free recall still outperfomed the other study methods. 

It seems undeniable that free recall is the best study method.

### Difficulty in learning

It seems that difficulty and learning is intrinsincally linked. Free recall testing, where the student needs to recall
as much as possible without any asistance, results in better tetention that recall tests where the students are given hints.

Giving someone a test immediately after they learnt someone fares *worse* than giving them the test with a slight delay,
where the information is not as fresh and they need to work harder to recall the answers. Difficulty seems to be not an obstacle,
but maybe the goal of making retrieval work. 

This bodes well for ultralearning as a strategy. One of the core tenets is a high intensity approach. Strategies where the difficulty
is high immediately seem to fare really well as long-term strategies. However, be aware that too much difficulty is also undesirable. 
If recall is impossible, then the purpose of recall test are hampered. Test too long from when the imformation was acquired, and you risk
forgetting the information entirely. 

### Should  you take the final exam before the class?

An idea that seems preposterous is taking the test before studying any material. Trying really hard to solve questions of which you have no
knowledge of. However observation from retrieval research seem to imply that taking a test before learning any new material, makes 
the information much easier to retrieve in the future and makes it easier to learn information in the first place.

### How to Practice Retrieval

#### Tactic 1: Flash Cards

Flash cards are the classic way of retrieval. Pairing questions and answers and drilling them consistently is quite effective. 
Spaced-repetition system are the current best systems for them. Flashcards are helpful for stuff like memorizing systax, but for concepts
that are applied in real programs, they often don't fit a cue-response framework. 

#### Tactic 2: Free Recall

This tactic is often helpful after reading a section from a book (like the section I'm reading right now) or a lecture and try to 
write down everything you remember. Often being quite difficult and very hard to get everything down, but again, this type of difficulty
is welcomed. 

#### Tactic 3: Question-Book Method

This is a method for note taking. Rather than writing down the simplified answers and notes, you can write down the questions instead. 
E.g: Instea of writing down "The Magna Carta was signed in 1215", you can instead note down, "When was the Magna Carta signed?", thus
generating practice retrieval material for later, so long as you reference where you can get the answer from. 

#### Tactic 4: Self-generated Challenges

The aboce tactics are quite good for retrieval of simple information, but for skills, remembering information is not enough. In this case
you can create challenges for yourself to solve later. If as a programmer you read about a new algorithm, you can challenge yourself to 
use it in the future.

#### Tactic 5: Closed-Book Learning

Any learning activity can become a retrieval task if you cut the ability to search for hints. Concept mapping, a strategy which didn't
work particularly well, can be strengthened if you cut the ability to search for information. This makes sure that the information becomes
stored inside your head.

Looking back at many of the greats, people who have made great strives in their domain, it seems that they employed retrieval in 
some form or another. "Retrieval is not a sufficient tool to create genius, but it may be a necessary one."

## Principle 6: Feedback

This is one of the most consistent principles in ultra-learning, strategies often have very intense approaches where feedback is provided
almost immediately. Tristan de Montebello spoke multiple times per week. Benny Lewis, spoke to people in a foreign language immediately. 
Roger Craig, tested his Jeopardy! knowledge relentlessly. Feedback and ultralearning are an inseparable pair. 

However feedback is a double-edged weapon. A meta-study done by Avraham Kluger and Angelo DeNisi looking at hundreds of studies on feedback
found that in over 38%! of cases, feedback actually has a negative impact. This is largely on whether the feedback has useful information, 
or whether the learner uses the feedback correctly. 

An ultralearner needs to be on guard for two possibilities:

1. Do not ovverreact to feedback, positive or negative. 
2. Feedback impacting your motivation. Negative feedback being an obvious one, but also goes for positive feedback. 

The second point is incredibly important. The reason why feedback often goes underused is how uncomfortobale it is. It is often harsh
and fiscouraging and doesn't feel nice. Ultralearners however need to be aggresive when pursuing feedback. There's a reason why 
many of the most impressive projects involve feedback as a core part of the cycle. Avoiding a huge source of improvement in critiques
and assessments is a big weakness in many learning strategies. 

### What kind of feedback do you need?

As with most other questions like this one, the answer is it depends. The feedback needed for stand-up comedy would be 
significantly different than the feedback that would good for coding. A one size fits all approach would do more harm than
good. We can consider feedback into 3 parts: outcome feedback, information feedback and corrective feedback. 

#### Outcome feedback: Are you doing it wrong?

The first type of feedback, and the least granular, is outcome feedback. This tells you roughly how well you are doing overall
but not much more than that. It usually comes in the form of grades, pass/fails, A, B or C, or it can come in the form of aggregate 
feedback. The applause someone receives (or lack thereof), whether a product sells well or not. Whether or not a program runs or not.  

This type of feedback is the easiest to get, and research show that getting this feedback, which lacks a lot of other data, can
be helpful in an of itself.

#### Information feedback: What are you doing wrong?

This stands as a somewhat more detailed form of feedback than outcome feedback. This feedback tells you what you're doing wrong,
but doesn't necessarily tell you how to fix it. When speaking a foreign language with someone, their facial expression can tell you a 
great deal about when you used a word/phrase wrong, but can't tell you why or how to fix it. 

This kind of feedback is easy to obtain, when you have a real-time access to feedback source. A computer programmer when a program
is not compiling properly.  

#### Corrective feedback: How can you fix what you're doing wrong?

Finally the most descriptive, and the best, type of feedback is corrective feedback. Not only does it show you whether or not
something is wrong, but also tells you how to fix it. This is often available only through a coach, or mentor or teacher. 

Corrective feedback is the most constructive form, since it can spot weakness which would largely be missed by most other types
of feedback. 

#### Further notes on types of feedback

You need to be careful when upgrading feedback from a weaker to a stronger form. You can only upgrade from outcome to information
if the feedback tells you what you are doing wrong. You can only improve information to corrective when the feedback tells you how 
to fix it. It is also very important to evaluate whether or not the feedback is actually useful, sometimes when eliciting feedback,
you will get different advice, and it will be on you to decide which ones are useful and not. 

De Montebello noted that most of the advice people game him wasn't very useful, but its consistency was. Riot August, a video game
designer at Riot, a video game company, has a quote: 

- "Players are often very good at telling you when something is wrong, but are often terribly at fixing it"

### How quick should feedback be?

The research seems to be not in agreement. Some research argues in favour of faster feedback while some other studies have found 
that delaying the correct response of the original task might be more effective. Scott H. Young advices that in general, the faster
the feedback the better, helping recognise mistakes quicker. However feedback too soon, before you've given yourself a fair chance at 
attempting to solve the difficult problem before giving up, can result in detrimental results. 

### How to improve your feedback

There are tactics that a ultralearner can employ to get better feedback. 

#### Tactic 1: Noise cancellation

Any feedback are going to contain both a signal, the useful information, and noise. Noise is caused by random factors outside 
your control. If your writing gets more views one day, it might not be because your writing is sucessful but rather because
of algorithm shenanigans, or because it went viral or for a myriad of other reasons.

Combating noise requires us to filter feedback, carefully sifting through it and assessing how useful and applicable to the 
topic it is. 

#### Tactic 2: Hitting the difficulty sweet spot

Feedback is all about information, and more information means a higher ability to learn. If you know that success is guaranteed
by doing a challenge which is too easy, the feedback would provide little to no information. The harder the feedback is to predict
before doing the task, the more important it is. 

Many people avoid failure because the feedback of an unavoidable failure is not always helpful. But the opposite problem, feedback
being always too positive is a more pervasive problem. Ultralearners have to adjust their environment so that they neither fail nor 
succeed too often. If they fail too much then make the challenge simpler, if they fail too little then the task must be made more 
difficult. It's only when one can't reliably predict the success or fail, that the feedback is most useful. 

#### Tactic 3: Metafeedback

As with metalearning, metafeedback is feedback not on your performance, but on the learning strategy itself. Chess players
can use their ELO growth as a way to test different strategies. LSAT studiers could use their improvements on mocks. 
If your learning rate is too slow, that might an indictment that its time to experiment with other methods. 
You can also directly compare different study methods to see which work better.

#### Tactic 4: High-Intensity, Rapid feedback

Sometimes the trick is just to get a lot of feedback, a lot of the time. A lot of people are averse to getting feedback for fear 
of critiques and failures. Throwing yourself in an environment where feedback is often will you get you acclimated to feedback and 
provokes you to engage in learning more aggressively. 

### Beyond Feedback

Feedback is not an attack on your ego. Maximising the environment so it's mostly positive and successful might seem helpful at the start
but that is why it's a more pervasive issue than an environment of repeated failure. 

Feedback at its core is about useful information, it is not an attack on you personally, it's a tool to be used to examine your methodology.
A healthy approach to feedback is not just a core part of ultralearning, it's a necessity.

## Principle 7: Retention

This principle applies mainly for information dense skills, but really it's applicable any time when a person needs to remember a lot
of information. However, before we give the methods for keeping things memorised, let's shed some light into, perhaps, the reason
why we forget things in the first place. There are 3 dominant theories:

### Decay: Forgetting with Time

The most common sense theory, and the one believed by most people, is that memories slowly decay with time. Things that happened this week
are much easier to recall than things that happened last month, or last year, or even last decade. However there are obvious flaws with 
this theory, for example, some memories from childhood remain incredibly vivid while I could not remember what I ate for breakfast last week.
It seems true that decay is a factor in forgetting, but it's not the only one. 

### Interference: Overwritting Old Memories

Another theory suggests that similar memories occupy a similar space in our mind, kind of like files in a computer. Examples of these are like
when learning very similar information, learning what loops, recursion, repeat-until loops, while loops, go-to statements do, its very easy to
get them mixed up due to their similarity. 

### Forgotten Clues: Locked Box with No Key

The final theory posits that memories aren't forgotten, but rather they remain inaccessible due to forgetting a clue which bridges the input
with the memory. This attempts to explain moments where things are at the tip of our tongue and yet we can't remember it. The benefit of this 
theory being possibly true is that relearning this would be much easier since we wouldn't need to construct new memories but rather simply 
repair old ones.

None of these theories however, completely explain the mechanisms or the reason behind forgetting memories. I suspect that it's a mix of these
things plus some other factors like the intensity of the memory itself. 

### How Can you Prevent Forgetting?

There are various different methods that different ultralearners use to remember information. Some methods are likely better or worse depending
on how information dense the skill is, or what kind of information needs to be remembered. The methods will also change depending on whether
information needs to be retained for long-term usage, or whether it's only neccesary to remember for a short term. In general, there are
4 different memory mechanism used in ultralearning: 

#### Memory Mechanism 1: Spacing

This is likely the best studying advice that researc supports: Don't cram. Spreading learning sessions over longer intervals will lower 
performance in the short-run however, you will be rewarded with much longer information retention. If you had 10 hours to learn something,
1 hour each day seems to serve you better than 10 hours in one day. 

There are tools for spacing, space-repetition-systems (SRS), which can be used, one of the most famous ones being Anki, a open-source
program for creating and using flashcards. However, these aren't the only method, regularly doing mini-projects to refresh your skills,
taking a class where a person can use a language they otherwise wouldn't use, or any method which involves using your skill regularly 
serve as a great tool to keep the skills and knowledge fresh.

#### Memory Mechanism 2: Proceduralisation

There seems to be a difference between procedural skills, skills which build up and progress with time, compared with declarative knowledge,
thigs like knowing the pythagorean theorem or the sine rule. One theory suggests that all learning starts as declarative: Someone just learning
algebra will remember the rules as simply nothing more than knowledge, but as the rules are use more and more to manipulate different
expressions and equations, it goes from simply knowledge to a skill and a tool. 

Procedural skills are much harder to forget than declarative knowledge and the ways to turn the latter into the former seem to be focusing 
on drilling it until it becomes a core skill. Proceduralising something involves concious effort, taking some piece of core knowledge
and focusing on it until it becomes easy to remember. 

#### Memory Mechanism 3: Overlearning

This is something that is quite apparent: Practice above what is required to perform the skill. increases how long the skill sticks to memory. 
If it takes you 30 mins to remember how to use and code an algorithm, drilling it for another 30 mins to an hour might increase 
the time taken for the algorithm to be forgotten by a significant margin. 

This lends itself quite nicely with the last memory mechanism, they almost go hand-in-hand, and there are 2 main methods of overlearning:

1. Practicing the skill/knowledge more than is necessary to first remember.
2. Advanced practice, using a more complicated skill which derives from the first skill: e.g using calculus to remember algebra.

#### Memory Mechanism 4: Mnemonics

A classic tool in the ultralearning repertoire, using specific patters of words to remember a very niche piece of information. 
Mnemonics are incredibly powerful tools when used properly, Rajveer Meena, the Guiness World Recorld holder for memorising digits
of the constant pi, knows the number to 70,000 demical places. 

The book argues that the problem with mnemonics is two-fold:

1. They require a lot of deliberate work.
2. This is perharps the worst problem, the recall of memory is not automatic.

However I see one more problem:

3. It seems only mainly useful for very information dense projects rather than skill based projects.

As a programmer, which is mostly a practical area, it seems not incredibly useful.

### Winning the War Against Forgetting

It is human tendency to forget, but these methods and mechanisms provide tools to combat our very nature. Case studies like Nigel Richards'
and Rajveer Meena show however, that it need not be a losing one. Remembering things are a key part to any skill, no matter how practical 
they are, and it seems to be a case of how much hard work we put in, combined with some good strategy.  

## Principle 8: Intuition

Intuition is a skill (under my definition of what a skill is) and it is an incredibly powerful one. It is what allows masters of a craft
to whizz through problems and their solutions, it's what allows experts to look at a problem and know the answer instantly. In the words
of my beloved Haikyu!!

- "Talent is something you make bloom, instinct is something you polish." - Toru Oikawa

Masters can focus on the deep principles of a problem, rather than its superficial features. Building off of years of practice and experience,
intuition becomes a deadly tool. 

### How to Build Your Intuition

As mentioned before, practice and experience are a necessary component to build intuition. But not all practice nor experience is the same.
The book tells stories of Feynman convincing other students of the specialty of a French Curve (a device for drawing curves) since
the bottom is tangent to a horizontal line. This, is true for any smooth shape and its a fact of calculus, but his classmates didn't
realise this. This shows that just practice is not enough to build an intuition for the deep foundantional parts of a skill. 
So how we avoid building up superficial understanding?

#### Rule 1: Don't Give Up on Hard Problems Easily

A recurring theme in ultralearning by now is that difficulty is not to be shunned but to be embraced, and here it is no different. 
When coming up with a incredibly hard problem, your gut reaction might be to give up and see how it is done, but you should struggle with it,
even if you truly don't know a piece of foundational knowledge behind it. 

#### Rule 2: Prove Things to Understand Them

To master something it is necessary for you to not just take facts and information at its face value but to dig deeper. You need to wonder
the why? or the how? of the information and preferably even prove it yourself. This is something I love doing and why I an such a fan of the C
programming language. It is not enough to understand hash-maps and how they work, but to create them myself and to truly appreciate the inner working.
It is not enough to know that the operating system schedules different tasks but it's imperitive that I see and understand for myself why. 
For deep rich intuition, it is not a boon to wonder the deep working of something, but a requirement.

Something you can do to showcase if you know something deeply is to get a concept or knowledge fact and break it down. Not just mentally, but 
on a piece of paper. Draw and list all the small parts and how it works and how they are linked and compare with the real answer. Often people 
believe they know something deeply but when pushed to talk about it in any way beyond its surface, they are incapable of it.

#### Rule 3: Always Start with a Concrete Example

Human beings don't learn things very well if its abstract, but rather learn abstract rules from many different examples. In literature 
there is something known as the levels-of-processing effect, suggesting that simply how much time you spend on something is not a good
indication of how you'll retain it, but rather how you think about it. Given a problem, fact, or piece of skill/information it is important
to pair it with a concrete example. This is also a good form of feedback since if you don't understand something well enough, creating a 
satisfying example will be quite difficult. 

#### Rule 4: Don't Fool Yourself

"You're the easiest person to fool." was one of Feynman's most popular quotes. You should constantly seek to attack your knowledge. 
Keep asking questions about what you know, ranging from incredibly simple questions to the deeper, more complex questions. 
When learning about pointers in C, you might ask yourself:

- What is a pointer?
- Why is it useful?
- When is a concrete example to use it?
- Why is it called a pointer? 

Do not be afraid of asking yourself, or of others, really simple questions in hope you don't look stupid. It is very important that you 
always know your gaps in knowledge. 

### The Feynman Technique

This is a method to help develop intuition for ideas. It is quite simple: 

1. Write down the concept you want to understand. 
2. In the space below, exaplin the idea as if you had to teach it to someone else.
    1. If it's a concept, ask yourself how you would convey the idea to a complete beginner.
    2. If it's a problem, explain how to solve it and why the method works. 
3. If and when you get stuck, you found a gap in knowledge that needs to be filled. Either solve it on your own or go back to your notes.

An important effect of this approach is dispelling the illusion of depth of knowledge. If you lack the richness in a particular concept, this 
method will bring those to the light. 

There are some nuanced applications for this technique:

#### Application 1: For Things You Don't Understand at All

When concepts don't make sense in your head, this procedure can help you wrap your head around the idea. By going back and forth with 
the provided explanation and your own, you can keep going until you get a satisfying version that you understand. It helps if you sketch 
ideas and broad strokes as well.

#### Application 2: For Problems You Can't Seem to Solve

If there is a problem/solution that you can't seem to get hang of, something that helps is going through the problem step by step
while you generate an explanation. Making sure you delve deeper rather than summarising the problem. 

#### Application 3: For Expanding Your Intuition

The final application for the Feynman technique is for ideas so core to the skill/knowledge, that great intuition would be greatly helpful.
In these cases, generating illustrations, examples, analogies, visualisations etc... that would make the idea more understandable
for both you and beginners makes a huge help. 

When getting your head around concepts like voltage, coming up with analogies like wires being pipes and electrons being water, the voltage itself
is like the height of the pipe, forcing the water to flow the direction we want it to flow. 

### Demystifying Intuition

When a grandmaster can look at a position and instantly tell you what game it's from, when and who, it is easy to be discouraged. To look
at these people are simply magicians of their craft, not reachable by us mere mortals. But when you peel the layers back, these feats 
are simply showcases of great intuition. An like all other skills, something that can be trained by everyone, even us. 
What sets apart Magnus Carlsen from me is nothing intrinsic, but rather the great effort and care put for the craft.

## Principle 9: Experimentation

Here we are, the last principle. If someone not me is reading this I would be shocked, shocked I tell you. It's a big mess of notes,
some that hardly make sense probably. Still, we got here in the end.

When starting a new skill, following the most trodden path is sufficient to build a good base of knowledge. However, as your skill develops,
and progress slows down, it's often not enough anymore to follow another's path; you need to experiment to find your own. 
When starting out, the most common advice, is the most well supported, having losts of material, teachers and research done to support it. 
But as you get more and more advanced, there are less peers, less people to teach, less material to view, less research done and where small
differences at the start of the process begin deviating more and more.

Another reason why experimentation becomes more necessary as you approach mastery is that progress begins to plateau after a while. New knowledge,
skills, and information become harder to find and accumulate, and old drills become a matter of habit rather than necessity. 

Finally, as you reach expertise, many of the habits you have picked up as a beginner start to hinder your progress, mastery becomes not just 
a matter of progress, but also of unlearning ineffective approaches and finding the most direct path forward. 

There are three types of experimentation:

### 1. Experimenting with Learning Resources

The first place we can begin experimenting is with all the different options we have available to learn. As a programmer for example, we have a
myriad of options to begin learning, from textbooks, to videos, to online courses, to self assigned projects, to exercises and the list goes on. 
A good strategy to find the best way to learn a particular skill is to pick one of these resources and to apply it rigorously for some predetermined
time. Then you can evaluate how well it is working and whether or not to change approaches. 

### 2. Experimenting with Technique

As soon as you step away from the beginner level, the question moves not from "How can I learn this?" but to "What should I learn next?". As a novice
in Rust, at first one might be concerned only with learning the basics of Rust, however as he gets more comfortable with the language, topics like
Tokio async, CLI tools like clap, kernel building, GUI libraries/frameworks, wasm, etc... become open to learn. Once again when faced with a myriad 
of options, experimentation plays a key role in finding your way forward. 

### 3. Experimenting with Style

Finally, once you have become comfortable with the foundational skills and knowledge and have started to approach mastery, there is no right way to
tackle problems, but rather many different options to choose from, each with their pros and cons. And as always, when faced with choice, experimentation
becomes an option to weed what style of problem is suited both for you and the different class of problems. When is test driven development better,
when is agile better than a waterfall approach, etc... 

In each level of experimentation, your possibilities grow exponentially. And this brings a new form of tension, between spending time trying
new resources, techniques and styles, versus concentrating efforts on a single path. You must form a cycle of innovation, one where you move from
exploring new options, to settling down and honing one which you have chosen. 

### Mindset of Experimentation

To seriously integrate experimentation in your learning style, one must be clear that you can improve the way you work. You have be open to 
the idea that simply because advice and strategies are repeated by others, that one must not be chained down to it. The experimental mindset is
all about realising that not only is your ability something you can improve, but also the approach with which you improve.

### How to Experiment

Like many of the other principles that came before it, there are tactics we can employ to add experimentation to our ultralearning projects. 

#### Tactic 1: Copy, Then Create

The first strategy we can employ is to copy down others' solution to the problem, to emulate their style. At the beginning, the amount of 
choice is suffocating for any new learner, so copying down a masters style can help you simplify the choices you need to make. After you start
becoming more comfortable and able at the skill, breaking down why the style works and slowly deviating away from it become possible choices
you can take to start making your own approach. 

#### Tactic 2: Compare Methods Side-by-Side

This tactic is analogous to the scientific method. By controlling the variables and testing 2 different methods side-by-side, we can begin 
seeing the differences between them, their pros and cons and see what the impact is. If learning coding through self-assigned projects
provides better results than learning coding through books then that method becomes more appealing moving forward. 

#### Tactic 3: Introduce New Constraints

As mentioned before, as you master the skill, learning becomes not just about covering new material, but also unlearning past habits. 

- The challenge of learning in the beginning is that you don't know what to do. The challenge of learning in the end is that you think you already know what to do. - Scott H. Young, author of ultralearning

In such cases, the idea of adding constraints to your future learning, as a way to force you down a path you haven't been before, becomes more and more
appealing as a form of experimentation. 

#### Tactic 4: Find Your Superpower in the Hybrid of Unrelated Skills

This is advice on how to differentiate yourself from others. The normal path to greatness is to take a well-defined skill and to drill it 
to mastery. However a different approach, one that is more accessible for professional and creative skills, is to take 2 different skills and
to combine them into 1 specific niche. You might not be the best programmer, and also not be the best speaker, but the best programmer who
can give talks and teach new beginners. 

#### Tactic 5: Explore the Extremes

Finally, once you have stepped into the realm of expertise, exploring the extremes, finding a small subset of the skill and drilling it, pushing it
to its absolute ends, becomes something to consider. This is both as a way to stand out from the crowd, you can become the best 3-point shooter, 
as a way to sell yourself. But also this approach allows you find a personalised style for you, choosing something which you find unique, or
something you love, and becoming possibly the best at it. 

### Experimentation and Uncertainty

If learning is the processing of honing your skills, experimentation can become the process of honing your learning. The reality is, is that 
many of the skills we would live to learn, programming, maths, singing, dacing, drawing and even life at large, are deeply complex. They are rich and
full of different choices and paths and forcing yourself down one of these ways that others have chosen for you, is doing a big disservice to yourself.

Experimentation is as important as all the other principles covered so far. It's as important to the process as feedback is, as necessary as focus,
as helpful as drilling. While ultralearning is about choosing a project and dedicating a part of yourself to it, there's a lot of freedom involved,
do not deny yourself the ability to enjoy this freedom. 

## Your First Ultralearning Project

This section is going to be a summary and a compact to-do list of all the other principles. There's a quote however in this section
that is quite important to keep in mind. 

- "The biggest obstacle in ultralearning is simply that most people don't care about their own self-education to get started. As you've read this far, 
I doubt that is true of you. Learning, in whatever form it takes, is something that's important to you. The question is whether that spark of interest 
will ignite into a flame or be smothered prematurely" - Scott H. Young

As with most things, the biggest obstacle is not anything external, but ourselves. 

### Step 1: Do Your Research

The first step of any project is the metalearning research. At minimum the search should include: 

1. What topic you are going to learn and its aproximate scope.

You need to know what you are learning before you start. It's also quite helpful if the scope is narrow. Learning Coding as a scope is much
harder to start with than learning Rust.

2. The primary resources you will use. 

What materials you are planning to use, books, courses, videos, classes, tutorials, etc...

3. A benchmark for how others have successfully learned this skill or subject. 

It will be quite helpful to look online for the most well trodden path that others have taken. It's not necessary to copy it, but atleast to
make sure you haven't missed some key resources. 

4. Direct practice activities. 

It will be quite helpful to find things to do at the start as away to gauge how well you are progressing. Finding opportunities
to practice is helpful. 

5. Backup materials and drills.

In addition to the beginner material you want to cover, it might be interesting to consider any further material to use. Stuff that is 
helpful not now, but at some point in the future. 

### Step 2: Schedule Your Time

This is advice that is quite universal in self-improvement books. Atomic habits and Tiny habits both argue that before the habit or action
you want to take, setting up when and how long it will take is very helpful to make sure you stick to it. This is that same idea. 

Ultralearning will require some time investment and there are some things you will need to consider before starting: 

1. How much time will you commit? 

This is quite flexible, since how much time you have will change depending on your other commitments, but it is important that you 
devote a certain chunk of your time into it.

2. When will you learn?

After deciding how much time to spend, it is quite important that you spread that time effectively. There is no rule of thumb I could 
possibly give you since it all depends on your schedule, just make sure you stick to all the principles we stated e.g spread it around
evenly if possible. 

3. Make a note of the scheduling

It is important, both psychologically and logistically, that you know when the learning slots are and for how long. Something atomic habits hammers on 
and on, is how important it is to give concrete time. It helps you, for a lack of a better word, lock in. 

### Step 3: Execute Your Plan

Whatever you got planned, do it. Even if you are worried it's not perfect, it never will be, it is time to start putting your plan into motion. 
Sometimes you will only notice the gaps in your plan once you start it. Here are some questions to keep yourself from slipping:

1. Metalearning: Have I enough research? Have I interviewed successful learners/experts? Have I spent about 10% of total time 
preparing my project?

2. Focus: Am I focus when I am learning? Am I procrastinating? How long until I get a good flow? How long can I sustain focus?
Should my attention be more concentrated for intensity or diffused for creativity?

3. Directness: Am I learning the way I will apply the skill in the future? If not, what am I missing/doing wrong? How can I
transfere what I'm learning to real life?

4. Drill: Am I spending time on my weakest points? What is the rate-limiting steps holding me back? Is my progress slowing? Are there too 
many components to focus on? 

5. Retrieval: Am I spending most of time reviewing or retrieving things from memory? Do I have ways to test myself? Can I successfully explain
what I learned today? yesterday? A week ago? 

6. Feedback: Am I getting honest feedback about my performance? Am I dodging criticism? Do I know what I'm doing well or not? Am I using good
feedback or is it noisy data?

7. Rentention: Do I have a plan to remember what I'm learning? Do I space my learning so it will stick longer? Am I overlearning the core
parts of my skill? Am  I turning knowledge into procedure? 

8. Intuition: Do I deeply understand the things I'm learning? Could I teach these ideas to someone else? Is it clear to me why I'm learning
what I am learning and why it is true?

9. Experimentation: Am I getting stuck to a specific resource/technique/process? Do I need to branch out? Have I gone beyond and created a 
unique style? 

These questions will serve as a guide of whether or not you are sticking to the principles we have talked about. 

### Step 4: Review Your Results

After an ultralearning project, or if you decide to take a break, you should spend sometime as always analysing it. What went right? What went wrong? 
What should I do next time? 

Not at all projects will be successful, c'est la vie. All projects are worth analysing ones, the successful ones and even more specially, the 
unsuccessful ones. Each project can turn into a lesson for the next.

### Step 5: Choose to Maintain or Master What You've Learned

Also after a project you will have to make a decision, is it worth pursuing further what I've learned? If you choose not to, you will also 
have to decide whether or not to maintain knowledge of your skill, lest it wither away. 
You have 3 options:

1. Maintenance: Invest enough pratice to sustain the skill, but not much more than that. 
2. Relearn: You could simply decide to relearn the skill later when necessary, since relearning a skill happens much much faster. 
3. Mastery: Should you decide that this skill is something to focus on, you need to decide what to do from now on. 
What are the next steps to pursue and what is the best way to do so?


## Conclusion

Before going into this book, I did not know what to expect. I had a habit of picking up self-improvement books, reading them, maybe applying 
their advice for a bit before moving on into the next new thing. In the back of my mind, I had expected that this time would have been no different, 
and maybe really it isn't, only time can tell. 

There's something that ultralearning has shown me however, is that much of our actions are taken without deeper concious thought behind it. 
Learning can be a rich, complex thing and yet for most of my learning in my life, it was passionless. 

Learning can be a fun thing, it can be a life changing thing, it can make you great:

- "To be the greatest you need to have fun, and when you're having fun, you're the greatest." - Kotaro Bokuto, Haikyu!!
