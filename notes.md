# Personal Notes on UltraLearning

Many of the first pages of UltraLearning are, as many other first pages of 
self-improvements books, simply a pitch sale, coaxing the reading
into considering ultralearning for their life, as a way to significantly speed up the learning
of skills/knowledge. 

The author uses examples of people he has met/heard of, which have accomplished incredible things
using ultralearning and also explains that while these may be the most extreme positive examples of ultralearning,
anyone can still enjoy many incredibly positive advantages, so long as they approach ultralearning seriously.

I've been historically someone who doesn't focus on the mental aspects of self-improvement.
When, for example, reading up on Atomic Habits, of which the first couple of sections are dedicated on the
mental aspects and the why's for using Atomic Habits, 
I am someone who didn't really pay attention or consider it that deeply. 

My reasoning being not for any detrimental reasons, but rather that I considered the practical reasons more imporant. 
My idea of a human being mostly stems from a computer science approach, viewing the human body as nothing more than 
a biological robot. And thus, so long as you change the inputs, I could get the outputs, what I do, how I think etc...
to change. 

As more time goes on, this idea of biological robots seems less and less helpful for my self-improvement.
Not to say there are no benifits to this model, but there's quite a lot of examples, both personal and from other people,
where a strict adherance to practical advice with little regard to the mental side has led to a lack of positive change. 
And where many people's routine and habits change seemingly overnight without using any methodology or steps, from a simple
change in their mental approach.

Therefore, it is very important that I truly understand just how positively it could affect my life.
I admire the approach of ultralearning. Something that I continously strive for is to be great at what I love.
To be great at coding, to great at speaking to be great at my hobbies. 

A quote that embodies why this is so important to me is:<br/>
"Being good means being free" - Haikyu!! (My favourite piece of fiction ever)<br/>
I want to be great to not be tied down to anything. And I think ultralearning is what I need to make that true.

## Principle 1: Meta-Learning

UltraLearning is not just about really intense learning, but also a commitment to incredibly
efficient and pointed learning.

And the first step to this efficiency is Meta-Learning, learning about the way you will learn.

The overarching steps you need to answer during Meta-Learning are Why? What? and How?

- Why you are learning what you are learning?
- What exactly are you learning? and break it down to its parts and nuances
- How is it you will learn?

Each part comes with a method to help answer the question. 

- Expert Interview Method to help answer why:

Interview somebody who has learnt the skill you are seeking to learn to help research whether or not
the skill does in fact help you achieve your goals. It is important to not be shy, it is quite likely that 
the expert would love to share a bit of their time to help newcomers who are passionate about their expertise. 
Be forward and confident, while also being mindful of not taking too much of their time, 15mins is a good time frame. 

- Breaking down the skill/knowledge into Concepts, Facts and Procedures to help answer what. 

Knowledge can be broken down into 3 parts:
- Concepts: Ideas to be understood to be useful. stuff like abstraction in software development.
- Facts: Information that simply needs to be memorized, stuff like syntax in coding.
- Procedures: Skills that need to be practiced, stuff like diffentiation in calculus. 

- Benchmarking to help answer how:

Finally for how the learning will take place, benchmarking, learning how other people in the past has
learnt the skill/knowledge helps massively. Looking up courses, commonly repeated advice and the ways
experts have learnt their subject will serve as a really good way to find your own way to learn the skill.
It is very important that you do not just take these at face value and always emphasize or exclude the different
advice depending on whether they are helpful for your own journey.

### How long should I Meta-Learn for? 

The book recommends a good rule of thumb of 10%, that is 10% of your ultralearning process should be spent
researching how to learn the project. Another method, which I find most compelling, is research until you 
find yourself not covering new ground. If you research for an hour and end up with fruitful findings, then it is very
likely that you should still meta-learn some more however, if you find yourself getting the same answers or not going anywhere
during your research, it's time to and start learning the skill. 

## Principle 2: Focus
