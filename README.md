### UltraLearning

This is a repo to show my ultralearning journey. 
Each project will be given its own folder, detailing the process I have taken to
learn and develop the skills, accompanied by a timeline of events. 

The notes is a breakdown of my ultralearning process.
One that comes directly from the book by Scott H. Young
