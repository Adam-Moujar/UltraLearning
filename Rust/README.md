# Rust

## Meta-Learning

### Why?

I am someone who really values a minimal environment. 
I use arch-linux, I code in neovim with a very minimal kickstarter setup. 
My favourite language (as of 16/06/2025) is C and I love writing most of the code I use
with minimal external libraries even if there are better alternatives.

So it would be a huge shift to learn rust, A high level language, with a plethora of features.
The very simple reason is: I want to become a master with a language which can allow me to do anything.

In theory any language could work, C being one of the few languages which has been used in practically everything.
Rust is its spiritual successor in that sense. 

Rust is pushed to be used in every single type of software,
from web apps, to games, to the linux kernel, terminals, clis, even with the use of wasm, as a replacement for
javascript on the web.

I want to become great at Rust. To be able to write code I would never think to write before.
Not for a career (though I would love to possibly have one) but as a hobby.
