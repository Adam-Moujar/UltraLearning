## Notes

So far, the examples have actually had the modules in one file. 
It's quite easy, we remove the code inside the curly brackets of a mod into a 
separate file with the rules outlined in defining modules, and replace the curly brackets with a; 

Note that mod is not the same as an include keyword in other programming langauges, since
you only need to mod a file once into the mod tree before the rest of the modules can begin using it.
